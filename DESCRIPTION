Title: Fast solvers for non-negative linear model/regression (NNLM) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF or NNMF)
Description: This is a package for Non-Negative Linear Models. It implements
    fast sequential coordinate descent algorithms for non-negative linear regression
    and non-negative matrix factorization. It supports mean square error and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss.
    Many other features are also implemented, including missing value imputation, domain knowledge integration,
    designed W and H matrices, multiple forms of regularizations.
