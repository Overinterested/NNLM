Title: Fast solvers for non-negative least square (NNLS) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
Description: This is a package for Non-Negative Linear Models. It implements a
    fast sequential coordinate descent algorithm for non-negative least square (NNLS)
    and a fast algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization, with potentials to work with missing values,
    partially known and carefully designed W and H matrices.
