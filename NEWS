NNLM-0.3.0: 2015-11-19
======================

- `nmf_partial` was updated to `nnmf_general`, with two more greate features
	* NMF with masked entries in W and H forced to 0
	* Allowing missing values in matrix A, which is useful for missing
		value imputaiton and recommendation system.
- Add more potential applications on vignette

NNLM-0.2.0: 2015-11-08
======================

- NMF with partially known profiles, which can be used for 
	tumour content deconvolution with known healty profile
- Updated vignette

NNLM-0.1.0: 2015-11-04
======================

- OpenMP support for multiple threading
- Added progression bar and keyboard interrupt
- Added a vignette

NNLM-0.0.2: 2015-10-31
======================

- A very fast non-negative least sequare solver `nnls`
- Non-negative matrix factorization using alternativing NNLS and brunet
- Predict new coefficients from known profile descovered from NMF (`nnmf`)
