# NNLM
A package for Non-Negative Linear Models, including a fast non-negative least square (NNLS) solver and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)

# TODO
1. Add support for meta-genes: thresholding
2. Heatmap
3. Examples
4. Vignette
5. Test, code coverage, .traivs.yml
6. Parallel: OpenMP support
7. Support for missing values in NMF (how to handly in NNLS?) -> extremely usefull. Use NMF to impute missing values! (SVD for imputation as well)

# to be fixed
1. KL divergence `target_error`
